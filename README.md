# hue-deploy

Simple command line deployment for Hue automations and resources.

Define resources as a collection of YAML files. Reference other resources by name. Deploy.

Hue deploy will take care of:

- Resolving resource ids
- Applying sensible defaults
- Removes the need to prefix schedule.command.address with `/api/<GATEWAY_API_KEY>`, so schedule command addresses are consistent with rule action addresses
- Creating missing resources
- Updating outdated resources
- Deleting removed resources (where created by hue-deploy)
- Deploying things in the right order

Resource schema is defined in described in the [deCONZ API docs](https://dresden-elektronik.github.io/deconz-rest-doc/).

## Limitations

- This tool should be considered a work in progress and could have breaking changes between versions.
- Currently only tested with a Deconz gateway
- Only one collection of resources can be deployed to a given gateway (due to the way resources are tracked to allow update/delete)
- Dependencies across files are not recommended, as ordering is undefined

## Usage

### Installation

- Install node 18 or above
- Install the tool with `npm install -g hue-deploy`

### Quick start

```sh
hue gateway set <YOUR_GATEWAY_IP> <YOUR_GATEWAY_API_KEY>
```

```sh
hue deploy # from current directory
hue deploy --from ~/my-hue-resources # from specific directory
```

Example `some-resources.yml` within directory `~/my-hue-resources`:

```yml
resources:
  - kind: sensor
    name: my-virtual-switch
    type: CLIPGenericFlag

  - kind: rule
    name: my-switch-on
    actions:
      - address: '/sensors/my-virtual-switch/state'
        body:
          flag: true
        method: PUT
    conditions:
      - address: /sensors/my-switch/state/lastupdated
        operator: dx
      - address: /sensors/my-switch/state/buttonevent
        operator: eq
        value: '1002'
      - address: /sensors/my-virtual-switch/state/flag
        operator: eq
        value: 'false'

  - kind: schedule
    name: bedroom-phone-charger
    command:
      address: lights/bedside-socket/state
      body:
        on: true
      method: PUT
    localtime: W127/T00:30:00
```

The from directory can be located anywhere. You can have as many resource files as you like within there. Filenames are not significant and can be renamed without any impact.

Preview changes to be made first, with:

```sh
hue preview
```

## Contributing

Please raise issues for any bugs/feature requests.

Testing has been through actual use with a good number of resources on a home setup. There are no automated tests yet. Can hopefully add some soonish.

##Â Release process

Update the version number in `package.json` and:

```sh
yarn build
npm publish
```
